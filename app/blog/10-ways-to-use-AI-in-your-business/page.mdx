### Does your product even need AI?

Know your users and your solution before thinking about using AI. AI costs more money to use. AI can add complexity where a simple solution could be far easier and cheaper.

### Start with "why"

the AI revolution is here. There is time to join it! Don't waste time building the wrong AI feature in your product. Use this guide to figure out what you should spend time boosting with AI, and what you should skip.

### Find existing pain points

- Where do your customers say something is difficult or painful in their journey?
- Where is there a difficult interaction in your feature or product?
- Where is there an unfulfilled feature request that your team wants to take on?

### Don't use AI just because

- If you didn't use any AI, what would the solution look like?
  - Try to take account of the total friction, effort, or number of interactions (interaction cost) the non-AI solution might take, and the delta between a non-AI and AI-boosted technical approach
- Sometimes AI-boosted could be a cheaper path, but typically it will be more expensive.

### Boosting with AI

- How would this AI-boosted solution:
  - Save time for users on tedious, boring, or challenging tasks
  - Empower creativity for users by offering examples they might otherwise not know about
    - Help users move past the blank page and start remixing examples instead of having to come up with new ideas out of nothing
    - Help you become more confident using a complicated product by empowering "learning by doing"
  - Add accessibility options that were previously missing like captions or vision assists
  - Improve the overall quality of content, ideas, architecture, frameworks, or any written content
    - Grammar, structure, and prose
    - Sermon notes and questions
  - Help you search for or find something faster than another solution using natural language processing
  - Automate something boring or mind-numbing through computer vision or trained models
    - Data entry
    - Video generation
  - Generate insights that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive or extremely tedious to discover
    - Analytics crawler for your own unique data. Like having your own plug-and-play data analyst that can generate insights on your private data.
    - Open-source and fully private.
    - Automated reports based on your preferences every week
  - Offer unique personalization in your product, like recommendations or suggestions for creating new things
    - User behavior can drive powerful content recommendation
  - Help you manage a task or workflow that would otherwise require a person's careful review and attention
    - AIs are more accurate, don't get tired, don't get bored, and can review things 1,000,000,000 times faster than a human, and are infinitely patient
  - Multiply the impact of a single user 2-10x by speeding up decision making through a programmatic AI agent
    - A single person can orchestrate a team of AI agents to run an entire business
- How would this AI-boosted solution reduce:
  - The total friction, effort, or number of interactions (interaction cost)
    - Show the UX Flow and take note of the time and effort savings in # of steps or complexity of the chart

### Human in the loop

- What's the cost to your users if an AI is wrong? Your company?
- Does a human need to verify and tweak responses? Or is close enough good enough?
- You are ultimately responsible for the responses from an AI, so consider how to mitigate risks there

### Determine real value

Is this actually helping your users, or just making it more complicated? Is it generating enough more business to justify the costs?

### Get realistic about your timeline

Be realistic about how long it will take to:

1. gather data (if needed)
2. build the feature or product
3. if that feature or product will still be relevant (evergreen problem) by the time you're done building

### Final checklist

- [ ] Identify your target product
- [ ] Pain points to address
- [ ] Solution you want to build
- [ ] AI + data you need to build it
- [ ] If you need a human in the loop

### Estimating costs, risks, and vendor lock-in

- AI costs money. How will your solution:
  - Be hosted and run? What new infrastructure is needed?
  - What model will it use, and at what speed?
    - What models can we afford, and what models do we actually need for the capabilities of the feature?
    - How fast will we need a response to inference?
    - How will we display loading / failed / error states when the model hallucinates?
  - What is uptime and downtime
    - What will ensure uptime for this model?
    - How will the model be throttled or not depending on usage?
  - How will we avoid losing money through system abuse or "jailbreaking" of a model?
  - API or local? On the edge?
