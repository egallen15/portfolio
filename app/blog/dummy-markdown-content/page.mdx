## Dummy Markdown

This is a sample markdown document that includes YAML frontmatter. You can use this template as a starting point for your own markdown documents.

## Section One

Here is some example content. Markdown allows you to create headings, lists, links, and much more.

- **Bold Text** is created with double asterisks.
- *Italic Text* is created with single asterisks.
- [Links](https://example.com) can be added easily.

---

## Section Two

Feel free to add more sections, `code blocks`, images, or any other markdown content you need.

```python
# This is a Python code block example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```
