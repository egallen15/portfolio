Prompting is just a fancy word for _asking good questions_. The clearer your instructions, the better your results. Here’s how to master the basics.

### 1. Be Clear and Specific

Bad prompt:
> Tell me about design.

Better prompt:
> Explain the difference between UX design and UI design in one short paragraph.

**Why it works:** You’re setting boundaries — what to explain and how long the answer should be.

---

### 2. Give Context

AI works best when it knows your situation.

> I’m a senior UX designer working on a dashboard for church administrators. Explain how to improve readability and reduce visual noise.

Adding context helps the AI tailor its response to your world.

---

### 3. Use Examples

Show what you want.

> Write a short blog post about volunteering.  
> **Example tone:** friendly, hopeful, conversational.  
> **Length:** 200 words.  

Examples are like calibration — they guide tone, structure, and depth.

### 4. Break Down Complex Requests

Instead of one giant question, split it into steps:

> 1. Create an outline for a prayer app landing page.  
> 2. Then, write the hero section copy.  
> 3. Finally, suggest an image for the hero area.

Breaking things down helps the AI follow your flow.

### 5. Ask for Iteration

Don’t stop after the first answer. Try:

> Make it punchier.  
> Add bullet points.  
> Use a more confident tone.

Think of it as a collaboration — not a one-shot request.

---

### 6. Set Format Expectations

Tell the AI how to structure the output.

> Output as a Markdown table.  
> Write JSON I can paste into VS Code.  
> Give me a numbered list of tasks.

The clearer your format, the faster you can copy and use the results.

---

### 7. Combine Roles and Goals

Start prompts with who you are and what you’re trying to do:

> I’m building a personal portfolio in Next.js. Help me write a short “About” section that sounds confident but humble.

This pattern — **Role + Goal + Task** — works for nearly everything.

### Quick Reference

| Prompting Principle | What It Means | Example |
|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Be specific | Say exactly what you want | “Summarize this in 3 bullet points.” |
| Add context | Include your role or purpose | “I’m a developer learning React.” |
| Give examples | Show tone, format, or style | “Use a calm and professional tone.” |
| Iterate | Ask for changes | “Make it more concise.” |
| Structure output | Define the format | “Write in Markdown.” |

#### Final Thought

Prompting isn’t about tricking the AI — it’s about thinking clearly.  
If you can explain what you need to a person, you can prompt well.
