          In 2018, I joined Subsplash as a UX Designer. Since then, I&#39;ve helped
          Subsplash ship dozens of experiences:

        <ul className="prose dark:prose-invert pt-6 list-disc list-inside"> 
          <li>Launched new products contributing to 6 years of ~40% YOY growth.</li>
          <li>Designed core payment flows generating millions in recurring revenue.</li>
          <li>Iterated on dozens of improvements across a broad platform (web, mobile, TV).</li>
          <li>Trained new UX Designers on how to maintain Subsplash&#39;s industry-leading NPS scores (35+).</li>

          I enjoy the thrill of cracking intricate design puzzles with simple
          solutions. My top career ambitions are: Build beautiful products that
          solve real problems, cultivate strong and meaningful friendships with
          teammates, and make work feel like play by empowering authenticity.

          I live in the Austin, TX area with my family. My perfect day starts
          with a walk to a caf√©, and ends with a great movie. I&#39;m always up
          for a chat about design, tech, or life in general. Feel free to reach
          out!
