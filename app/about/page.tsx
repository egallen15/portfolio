          In 2018, I joined Subsplash as a UX Designer. Since then, I&#39;ve helped
          Subsplash ship dozens of experiences: Launched new products
          contributing to 6 years of ~40% YOY growth. Designed core payment flows
          generating millions in recurring revenue. Iterated on dozens of
          improvements across a broad platform (web, mobile, TV). Trained new UX
          Designers on how to maintain Subsplash&#39;s industry-leading NPS scores
          (35+). I enjoy the thrill of cracking intricate design puzzles with
          simple solutions. My top career ambitions are: Build beautiful
          products that solve real problems, cultivate strong and meaningful
          friendships with teammates, and make work feel like play by empowering
          authenticity. I live in the Austin, TX area with my family. My perfect
          day starts with a walk to a caf√©, and ends with a great movie. I&#39;m
          always up for a chat about design, tech, or life in general. Feel free
          to reach out!
