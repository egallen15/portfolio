excerpt: If you have an idea you can express clearly, you can prototype.

To make a good prototype, you just need a few things:

- an idea you can express
- a loose idea of the data model and ux flow
- a loose idea of the tech stack
- milestones

If you can type this into a document, then you can build it with an agent. 

Ask an agent to interview you about a prototype idea you have.

Work through the interview, and when you're feeling good about the summary, ask it to summarize everything in a PLAN.md file.

### plan.md ➡ prototype

Every idea should be able to be squashed into a portable `PLAN.md` file. This plan should be cross-examined with appropriate `AGENTS.md` context to build in the right way.

That means if you can get a `plan.md` file put together out of the `IDEA` phase, then you're on your way to immediate prototyping, assuming the only thing needed to implement a prototype with a capable set of Agent instructions is a detailed plan.

### execute the plan

The plan is now your core resource. bring it to life like this:

```md
Execute this plan: [paste PLAN.md]
```

### steer the agent
Then just have a conversation with the agent about what you want to change.
